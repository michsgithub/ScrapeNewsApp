# ScrapeNewsApp

Things have been done are:

Design and structure of the MVC application which includes, Controller, Views and Models

#Controller:
*All routes are included in controller cnbcNews.js

#Views:
*handlebars template for the Index page to satify homework requirement
*Index.html is the main page where use can view article summary; read details of article offsite linking to the CNBC site.
User can also add comments about the article or delete the comment. 

#Models:
*2 models to store data for articles and comments


This is still not a functional application.
